        The event object in JavaScript is an object that is automatically passed to event handler functions when an event occurs. 
        It contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element, and any additional data related to the event.

        Common properties of the event object include:
        1. type: The type of event (e.g., "click", "keydown").
        2. target: The element that triggered the event.
        3. key: The key that was pressed (for keyboard events).
        4. clientX and clientY: The coordinates of the mouse pointer (for mouse events).

        <b>Example:</b>
    </pre>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="myInput"
      placeholder="Type something..."
      style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px"
    />
    <script>
      let input = document.getElementById("myInput");

      input.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
        console.log("Key pressed: " + event.key);
        console.log("Key code: " + event.keyCode);
        console.log("Event type: " + event.type);
      });
    </script>
