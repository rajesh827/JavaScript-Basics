        An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript.
        It was introduced in ES6.
        They have a cleaner & shorter syntax.
        They do not have their own this, arguments, or super.
        They are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

        <b>Syntax:</b>
        const functionName = (parameters) => {
          // function body
        };
    </pre>
    <script>
      const factorial = (n) => {
        if (n < 0) return "Invalid input";
        let result = 1;
        for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
          result *= i;
        }
        return result;
      };

      const number = 5;
      const fact = factorial(number);
      console.log(`Factorial of ${number} is ${fact}`);
    </script>
