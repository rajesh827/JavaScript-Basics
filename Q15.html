        An event in JavaScript is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, which can be detected and handled using JavaScript. 
        Events can be triggered by user interactions (like clicks, key presses, mouse movements) or by the browser itself (like page load, resize).

        Common types of events include:
        1. Click: Triggered when an element is clicked.
        2. Keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
        3. Load: Triggered when the page has finished loading.
        4. Mouseover: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.

        <b>Example:</b>
    </pre>
    <button id="myButton" style="width: 150px">Click Me</button>

    <p id="status">Waiting...</p>

    <script>
      var btn = document.getElementById("myButton");

      btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("Hello! using addEventListener.");
        document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = "Button was clicked!";
      });
    </script>
  </body>
